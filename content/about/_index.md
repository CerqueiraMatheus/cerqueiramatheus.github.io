Title: About
---

Hi there ðŸ‘‹! My full name is Matheus Henrique de Cerqueira Pinto, but you may refer to me as Matheus Cerqueira or just Matheus. Currently, Iâ€™m a Computer Science undergraduate at University of Sao Paulo, located in Sao Carlos, Brazil.

Iâ€™m passionate about computers since I was a kid. Some of my best childhood memories are with Barbara, my cousin, teaching me how to use a computer. There were also a lot of times that my parents got upset because I broke the OS of our shared PC trying to discover secrets and improve performance. But wellâ€¦

Some years later, especifically in 2016, I officialy started to study computers. I became a Computer Technician at Federal Institute of Parana (IFPR), in Jacarezinho, my hometown. During the four years that I spent there, I learnt and taught robotics, wrote articles, developed websites and apps and almost reached Harvard.

Then, following my passion, I decided to continue my learning path studying Computer Science. Despite all problems that COVID-19 brought to our world (and mainly to Brazil), in 2020, I got enrolled in the biggest Latin America university, University of Sao Paulo (USP).

Since then, Iâ€™ve been studying several themes, since Data Structures, Mobile Development and Operational Systems to Data Science and Machine Learning applied to cancer cases prediction.
